RSA Algorithm Implementation

This project implements the RSA encryption and decryption algorithm in JavaScript. The RSA algorithm is a public-key cryptosystem that is widely used for secure data transmission. This simple project allows users to input two prime numbers and a plaintext message, apply the RSA algorithm, and view the encrypted and decrypted messages.
Features

User inputs two prime numbers (p and q).

User inputs a plaintext message.

The program calculates:

Public key (n, e) using the input prime numbers.

Private key (n, d) using the public key and Eulerâ€™s Totient function (phi).

The program encrypts the plaintext message using the public key.

The program decrypts the encrypted message using the private key.

Displays both encrypted and decrypted messages.
